# Assembler
The program receives assembler code and translates it to binary (and then outputs the binary as base 64 characters)
This project was in the Open University course Computer Programing Lab (20465).
This is my assembler project for MMN 14

about running:
(in the same directory)
1. run the makefile with >make
2. write >assembler test1 test2 Ctest(files for testing)
3. If you want to test the errors and warning run Atest Btest
